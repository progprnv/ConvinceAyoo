# Convince Ayoo üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Convincing Scripters


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Pranav Jayan - SCMS School Of Engineering And Technology
- Member 2: Janish Saji - SCMS School Of Engineering And Technology
- Member 3: Roshan Subhash - SCMS School Of Engineering And Technology 

### Project Description
*ConvinceAyo* is a decision-making assistant that provides counter-persuasive arguments for user-entered decisions. Enter a query, and it will list reasons opposing the decision, helping you consider all perspectives before proceeding. Powered by Flask and Ollama.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Decision-making can be overwhelming, especially when we don't have enough negative reasons to steer us in an opposite direction. People often lack a good, harsh roast for their own ideas, which could help them think more critically before taking the plunge. With all the positive influences out there, where‚Äôs the blunt, unapologetic critique when you need it most?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Introducing ConvinceAyoo ‚Äì the tool you never knew you needed to provide you with brutally honest, sarcasm-laden arguments against your own ideas. Simply type in your decision, and ConvinceAyoo will deliver a compelling list of reasons to make you think twice. Perfect for anyone looking to roast their own ambitions before fully committing ‚Äì because who doesn‚Äôt love a little self-sabotage humor?
